    How to make a latte at home? It’s pretty simple, once you know a few tricks. Let’s get started!   
    </p>
<h2 class="coffe"><a>What is a latte?</a></h2>

<p class="second-paragraph">
A latte is a coffee drink with espresso, steamed milk and a layer of foam on top.<br>
What’s the difference between a latte vs a cappuccino?<br>
A cappuccino has equal parts espresso, steamed milk and foam (⅓ each).<br>
A latte has ⅓ espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, with a thin layer of foam on top.<br>
Oh, and a macchiato is just espresso with a thicker layer of foam on top. (Here’s a chart that breaks it down.)
<hr>
One special thing to note about a latte is the type of foam you want to get.<br>
You want the milk to get to an almost “wet-paint” like texture, which baristas call microfoam.<br>
It can be tricky to get to that texture without a steamer, so we’ll show you how to approximate it with some various tools you might have on hand.
</p>
<h3>First, let’s talk espresso</h3>
<hul>
    <li>Espresso roast coffee: The roast is important to get the right dark, bitter flavor.
         Also make sure to use a fine grind on the espresso when you make it.</li>
    <li>Espresso machine, manual espresso maker, or Aeropress: 
        Tere are several ways to make espresso. We use an espresso machine, which sits on a countertop.<br>
        Or you can use a small manual espresso maker: it’s cheaper and portable!
         For the cheapest option, you can use an Aeropress; go to our Aeropress Espresso recipe for more.</li>
  </ul>
<h5><a></a>Instructions</a></h5>
<p>
<ol>
    <li><em>Make the espresso</em>: Use an espresso machine or manual espresso maker 
    to make two shots of espresso and pour it into a mug (or try our Aeropress Espresso).</li>
    <li>
        <em>Steaming method (espresso machine)</em>: 
        Place the milk in a pitcher. Hold the steaming wand just below the surface of the milk until it doubles in size. 
        This makes foamy froth. Then, move the steaming wand lower and near the side of the pitcher to create a spiral vortex. 
        This makes the silky smooth microfoam bubbles and wet-paint texture that’s characteristic of a latte. 
        Steam until the milk reaches 150 degrees Fahrenheit (use a thermometer or judge by when your hand can’t hold the 
        pitcher for more than a few seconds).
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Serve</em>: Tap the milk container on counter and swirl it to break down any large bubbles. 
        Pour milk into center of the espresso, ending with light foam. 
    </li>
</ol>
